# Your Bar & Fridge (Your BF)

## Description

Sometimes we don't know what to eat or drink. So we've created an interactive and responsive website using 2 server-side APIs with a client-side storage for this problem. 
We've utilized APIs to retrieve information on recipes as well as generating a random cocktail to pair with the food.

 For our front-end framwework, we used 'foundation' to design our project. 

 Our motivation for our project is to solve a common problem we have, as well as to apply what we've learned so far.

 We've learned how to use client-side storage to store constant data, selecting and dynamically generating HTML elements and content using Web API methods, storing and retrieving data using the browser's local and session storage, implementing CDNs to leverage third-party APIs, implementing front-end developing frameworks, and using JavaScript frameworks to select, traverse, and manipulate the DOM.
